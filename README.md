## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# Laravel Breeze - Next.js Edition 🏝️

## Introduction

This repository is an implementation of the [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits) application / authentication starter kit frontend in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). All of the authentication boilerplate is already written for you - powered by [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/sanctum), allowing you to quickly begin pairing your beautiful Next.js frontend with a powerful Laravel backend.

## Official Documentation

### Installation

First, create a Next.js compatible Laravel backend by installing Laravel Breeze into a [fresh Laravel application](https://laravel.com/docs/installation) and installing Breeze's API scaffolding:

```bash
# Create the Laravel application...
laravel new next-backend

cd next-backend

# Install Breeze and dependencies...
composer require laravel/breeze --dev

php artisan breeze:install api

# Run database migrations...
php artisan migrate
```

Next, ensure that your application's `APP_URL` and `FRONTEND_URL` environment variables are set to `http://localhost:8000` and `http://localhost:3000`, respectively.

After defining the appropriate environment variables, you may serve the Laravel application using the `serve` Artisan command:

```bash
# Serve the application...
php artisan serve
```

Next, clone this repository and install its dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`. Then, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and supply the URL of your backend:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Finally, run the application via `npm run dev`. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`:

```
npm run dev
```

> Note: Currently, we recommend using `localhost` during local development of your backend and frontend to avoid CORS "Same-Origin" issues.

### Authentication Hook

This Next.js application contains a custom `useAuth` React hook, designed to abstract all authentication logic away from your pages. In addition, the hook can be used to access the currently authenticated user:

```js
const ExamplePage = () => {
    const { logout, user } = useAuth({ middleware: 'auth' })

    return (
        <>
            <p>{user?.name}</p>

            <button onClick={logout}>Sign out</button>
        </>
    )
}

export default ExamplePage
```

> Note: You will need to use [optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining) (`user?.name` instead of `user.name`) when accessing properties on the user object to account for Next.js's initial server-side render.

### Named Routes

For convenience, [Ziggy](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy#spas-or-separate-repos) may be used to reference your Laravel application's named route URLs from your React application.
